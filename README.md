## Research Questions

Our research questions:

- What are the different types of accidents on Victorian roads?
- How does the speed zone affect the severity of accidents?
- What demographic of people are most involved in accidents?
  - Males vs. females
  - Age groups
  - Pedestrians or passengers
- What Local Government Areas (LGAs) have the most accidents? Which LGAs have the least?
- How has the number of accidents changed over the years (2012 - 2024)?
- What types of vehicles are mostly involved in accidents?
- What are the most risky conditions to drive in?

## Ethical Considerations

The dataset used in this project is available publicly on the Victorian government website for data. At most, the dataset only includes the gender and age group of the driver, as well as the car that was involved in the accident. However, this is not enough to pinpoint the individual and is therefore does not breach the privacy of any individual.
